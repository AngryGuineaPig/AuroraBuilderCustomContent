      <p>At 1st level, you gain one of the following features.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b>Blink.</b> You can use your bonus action to teleport up to 10ft away to an unoccupied space you can see. While moving this way you don't provoke opportunity attacks and are invisible. You can also spend 15ft of movement to travel 30ft.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b>Displace.</b> You can use your bonus action to form a Void link up to 30ft from you. On your next turn you can teleport to the Void link as a bonus action, not provoking attacks of opportunity. The link stays for 1 minute or until you dismiss it. If you move further than 60ft away from it it dissipates, you can teleport to the link as a bonus action as long as it exists. It is invisible.</p>
