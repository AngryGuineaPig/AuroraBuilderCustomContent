      <p>Starting at 1st level, your patron teaches you about dreams, and how they can effect living creatures, even while they're awake. When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force them to make a constitution saving throw. On a failure they suffer a point of exhaustion for the next minute. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your charisma modifier per long rest. Creatures that are immune to exhaustion are immune to this effect.</p>
