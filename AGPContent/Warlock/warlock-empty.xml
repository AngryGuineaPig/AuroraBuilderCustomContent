These people find themselves on a day to day basis staring into a void that whispers to them dark secrets and ideas, but only those who look into the void and scream back can truly understand how morbid these thoughts truly are. The Empty are those who when scorned by not only people, but the primal forces of the world be it the gods ore the elements themselves would do anything to fill an all encompassing void within themselves. Those cursed with this power feel only ever the need to consume and fill the void that lies within themselves.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, you have a number of soul shards equal to your charisma modifier that can be used to amplify certain powers.</p>
      <p><b>Soulburn.</b> Once per turn when casting a warlock spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage you may expend a soul shard to have the spell deal additional necrotic damage equal to your charisma modifier. If you later gain the pact of the blade or chain boon you may use this feature on attacks made with your pact weapon or familiar.</p>
      <p><b>Haunt.</b> When you see and enemy within 30ft of you regain hit points as a result of a spell you may use your reaction to expend as many Soul Shards as you have to reduce the amount healed equal to your charisma modifier times the number of expended Soul Shards.</p>
