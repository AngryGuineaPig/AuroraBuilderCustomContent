      <p>We live our lives taking each second for granted. But what would you do if you knew how much time you had left? Warlocks of Unus Annus seek to answer this question. By taking this pack, they knowingly put a time limit on their lives, and intend on living out their lives to the fullest. Warlocks of this pact are perfectly content with the limited time of their lives, for they understand that all things must die, as is the natural order of things. They view undead as abominations that must all be destroyed, much like worshipers of the Raven Queen.</p>
