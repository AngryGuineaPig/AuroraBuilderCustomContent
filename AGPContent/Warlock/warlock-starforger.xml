      <p>At 1st level, you can delay your spells, casting them when you need them the most. When you cast a warlock spell of 1st-level or higher on your turn, you may suspend it for up to 1 minute. A suspended spell has no immediate effect instead you may use your reaction to cast the spell at any point during that time (including on your turn). If the minute passes without you casting that spell the spell slot is used. You may only suspend 1 spell at a time.</p>
