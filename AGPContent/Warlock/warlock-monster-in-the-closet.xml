      <p>The weird shadow on the wall, the unsettling creak of the floorboards, the soft scratch against the window. Sometimes the imaginary monsters hiding in the dark are not at all imaginary. Sometimes they don’t fade away as children grow into adults. Sometimes those adults prove to be just as frightening as the monsters themselves.</p>
      <p class="indent">Warlocks with a Monster in the Closet patron might know their monster only as a haunting memory, or they may get together, person-to-monster, on a regular basis. The monster may have tormented the warlock in their youth or it may have quickly become a lifelong friend. Some of these boogiemen are lighthearted tricksters; others, dark and violent. Whether bound by caring or a shared loathing, warlock and monster work together in terrifying tandem.</p>
