      <p>You have made a pact with a being that exists beyond time. Perhaps they are a denizen of the Astral Plane, or some other dimension which has never felt time's unceasing touch, or even from the Twilight Realm known only to the Shade Lords from the first age of Sharth.</p>
      <p class="indent">Does your patron seek an end to time in your world too? Or some other goal which only their a temporal eye can see?</p>
      <p class="indent">Did your patron offer you their power as you thought your time was at an end or did you find more than you expected from a journey to another plane?</p>
      <p class="indent">Wherever your powers came from, your timeless patron now offers you the power to control the flow of time to destroy your enemies and further its ageless agenda.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, your patron grants you a portion of their power to create time fissures. As an action, you can create a number of time fissures equal to your Charisma modifier within 60 feet of you that you can see. A time fissure is a point with a 5-foot square centred on it that does not obstruct line of sight or movement and is clearly visible. When a creature other than you enters a time fissure or starts its turn in one, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is frozen in time until the start of their next turn. A creature which is frozen in time is paralyzed, immune to all damage and all other conditions. Any effects which would last until the end of their next turn now last until the end of their turn after. Any conditions or effects the creature was under resume when they are no longer frozen in time.</p>
      <p class="indent">A time fissure immediately disappears once a creature has been forced to make a saving throw from it, 1 minute has passed, you use this feature again or until you dismiss all your time fissures as a bonus action.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>At 14th level, you can cause your time fissures to burst and rip those around them from their current time. As an action, you can expend a spell slot and destroy all of your time fissures forcing each creature within 10 feet of a time fissure to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot you expended, or half as much damage on a success.

			<p>Your patron grants you a special hourglass with sands that are fixed in time. While you are holding this hourglass, you may spend 10 minutes performing a ritual to peer into the past or future of the location where you performed this ritual. Name a particular point in time within your maximum temporal range shown in the table below. The sands within the hourglass begin to depict events which happened at the point in time you described at the location where the ritual was performed. Your DM may give you a detailed description of what occurred at the time which you specified but cannot convey what sounds were present.</p>

This may include during combat. You lose this ability once the event has passed or the situations have changed sufficiently that your prediction is no longer accurate.</p>
      <p class="indent">If you lose your hourglass, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous hourglass. The hourglass crumbles to sand when you die.</p>
