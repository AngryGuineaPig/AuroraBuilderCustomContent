            <p>Shadow Conclaves are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in Shadowy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a SHADOW CONCLAVE ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the shadows.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you can conjure shadowy replicas of your attacks that trail just behind them, containing a fragment of their original power. When you're not in an area of bright light, each time you make a weapon attack on your turn, your target takes 1d4 damage of the weapon's type regardless of whether or not the original attack hit. Additionally as a bonus action you can darken a 10ft diameter one light level for 1 minute.</p>

            <p>Starting at 15th level, you have changed your focus to letting shadows help and guide you to enforcing your will on your own shadow. As an action you can detach your shadow and have it latch onto another creature you can see, make a ranged spell attack on a hit your shadow latches on, on a miss it doesn't. Your shadow retains its shape but acts on your will. While you don't have your shadow you lose 10 from have your maximum hit points. While your shadow is attached to another creature you always know where that creature is as long as it is on the same plane as you. Additionally any attacks you make against the creature your shadow is attached to are made with advantage. Your shadow can attempt to siphon health from the attached creature to you. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 necrotic damage, you gain the number of hit points the creature looses.</p>
