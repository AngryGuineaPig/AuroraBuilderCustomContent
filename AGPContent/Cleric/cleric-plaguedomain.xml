			<p>By 6th level the blessing of your deity allows you afflict those who would normally resist your attacks. Whenever you cast a spell that deals poison or necrotic damage you can switch the damage type to necrotic or poison. Your spells can cause the poisoned condition to targets that are immune to the poisoned condition as long as they are not also immune to necrotic damage. If they are immune to both you can't overcome their poisoned immunity. The disease caused by Unleash the Plague is considered non magical and can't be dispelled by antimagic field or other such effects.</p>
