			<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level your blows are so heavy that they reform gravity around them. you gain the following benefits to your unarmed attacks:</p>
			<p class="indent"> Whenever you strike two different creatures with you unarmed attacks within five rounds of each other you can spend a ki point to create an attraction between the two. They must make a strength saving throw against your ki DC or be pulled towards each other at a rate of 10ft per round. When they collide they take a damage as if they had been falling towards each other</p>
			<p class="indent"> If you strike the same creature twice in the same round you can create a gravitational anchor. You can spend 1 ki point to create the anchor, for each 5ft the creature tries to move they must make a strength check against your ki DC. if they fail they loose all further movement on this turn.</p>

			<p>At 17th level your abilities at manipulating gravity have grown to the point where you can control direction to an unprecedented degree. When you strike a creature you can spend a number of ki points to launch it in a direction you choose. The creature must make a strength save against your ki DC on a success they move half the distance on a fail they move the full distance. The distance they move is equivalent to 30ft X the number of ki points you spend.</p>
