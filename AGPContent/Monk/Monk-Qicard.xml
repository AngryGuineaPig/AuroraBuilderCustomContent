			<p>At 17th level, you let the heart of the cards guide you in the most critical moments. When you take the attack action in which you replaced both attacks with Qi Card attacks, you can use your bonus action to prepare a Qi Card. Additionally you can use your action to expend 2 ki points to select one trap card and one creature within range of that spell as if you were casting. You can disable the rest of your trap cards including the selected one to cast the cantrip. If the target fails the saving throw then they take additional damage equivalent to 4 unarmed strikes for each trap card that you disabled. It takes half that amount on a successful save.</p>
