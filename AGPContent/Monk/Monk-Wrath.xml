			<p>At 17th level you can choose to end your Wrathful Trance early by expending all hatred into a single attack. You can spend a number of ki points to enhance the final attack. For each ki point you spend you deal another 1d10 + martial arts bonus for this final attack. For each round before the maximum of 20 you end the trance you deal an additional 1d8 damage. You can't use the Wrathful Trance feature after this until you have completed a short or long rest where you spend at least one hour re-building the rage inside.</p>
