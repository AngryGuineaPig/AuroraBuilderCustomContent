			<p>At 6th level, you have learned a technique to knock enemies feet from under them as the undercurrent in a tide does. When an enemy succeeds their saving throw against your stunning strike you can spend an additional ki point to knock them prone instead.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 17th level, your soul is as still as a pond and you can expand this aura of calm like ripples from an impact. You can expend 5 ki points to create an aura reaching out 20ft from you of complete calm. Any offensive spell or attack that moves past this aura or is made within this aura fails automatically friendly or otherwise. Additionally when you strike a creature who tried to make an offensive action in the aura you gain advantage. This effect ends after 30 seconds or until you end it as a bonus action or until you end it by making an attack. If you end it by making an attack you gain a number of d10 to the damage equivalent to the number of turns the aura was active. For example if you attacked after the first turn you'd gain 1d10, but after five turns it would be 5d10.</p>
