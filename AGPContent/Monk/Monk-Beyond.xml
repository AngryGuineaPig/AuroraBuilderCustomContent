			<p>Monks of the Way of the Beyond are incredibly rare. The number of people that believe that such a power exists or existed at all could be counted in the double digits. With the number training in such arts in the single digits. These monks learn techniques that follow the will of the masters they have never, and probably will never meet. Methods of which to pry open the very fabric of the world itself to meddle with it in ways never intended.</p>
