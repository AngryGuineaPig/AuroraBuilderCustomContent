			<p>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can use your bonus action to mark an enemy you can see within 60ft of you. If they visibly attempt to cast a spell you can use your reaction to make an attack against that creature. On a hit they must make a concentration check at disadvantage. If they fail then the spell fails, it consumes a spell slot however there are no further effects. After 1 minute the target ends. You can use this feature a number of times equivalent to your fighter level per short rest. At 6th level this increases to two targets, three at 10th level, 4 at 14th level and 5 at 18th</p>
