			<p>At 1st level, you can use your action to make a ranged spell attack to produce an instantaneous arcane tether towards a spellcaster you can see within 60ft. The tether is visible but intangible. The tether fails on non-spellcasters.</p>
			<p>Upon a successful tether you can choose a spell that you know they have or let the DM choose a random spell they know to copy. Once you are told the spell you can use a number of sorcery points equal to the spell level, the tether retracts from the spellcaster and that is now a spell you know, counting as a sorcerer spell. You can hold a number of spells using this feature equivalent to your charisma modifier.</p>
