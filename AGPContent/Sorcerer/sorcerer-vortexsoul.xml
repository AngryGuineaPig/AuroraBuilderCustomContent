			<p>At 1st level, you can subtly manipulate the gravity effecting you as a bonus action. You can either make it stronger or weaker.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Stronger.</b> You have advantage on strength ability checks and saving throws and can't be knocked prone. However your movement speed is halved.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Weaker.</b> Your walking speed increases by 10ft, you can jump twice as far and twice as high and difficult terrain doesn't cost additional movement. However you have disadvantage on strength saves or ability checks.</p>
			<p>You can end these effects or switch between them as a bonus action</p>

			<p>At 14th level you can enshroud yourself in a pocket of zero gravity as a bonus action. While the pocket exists you can "fly" at a speed of 30ft per turn and no gravity effects (such as reverse gravity) can effect you. The pocket lasts until you are incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action. Although you can technically fly, it is much closer to a constant falling. For this reason once you are in the air you can't effect your motion unless you have something to push off or some other way of generating a force (such as a loaded crossbow firing)</p>
