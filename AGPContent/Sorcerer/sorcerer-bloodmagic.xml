			<p>As you gain in your power you can tap on your life force to power your spells. You can take a number of d8s damage equivalent to the level of the spell that you are casting to reduce the spell slot to that of a cantrip. Additionally you can take a d8 damage to gain that number of sorcery points. This damage ignores all resistances and immunities. As you take damage you reduce your hit die by the number of d8 damage you take. (For a 5th level spell you take 5d8 damage and reduce your hit die by 5)</p>
