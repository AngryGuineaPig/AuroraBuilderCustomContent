As an action, you can choose a creature you can see within 60 feet of you that is made of or wearing a large amount of metal and force it to make a Strength Saving throw. The creature is paralyzed for 1 minute on a failed saving throw, and can remake the Saving throw as an action on each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, as an action, you can choose a metallic object that is huge or smaller and lock it in place as if it were an immovable rod.</p>
