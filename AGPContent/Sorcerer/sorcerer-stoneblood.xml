			<p>You are a stoneblood sorcerer, a mortal with an intrinsic tie to the elemental plane of earth. The stalwart power of stone suffuses your body making you immovable and unyielding as the mountains. Did you gain this power from an ancient earth elemental, barter for it with the greedy Dao, or are you descended from the original dwarves, molded from the bedrock of the world? The power that dwells within your blood urges you to remain steadfast in your decisions, and hoard the fruits of the earth; precious gems and alloys.</p>

			<p>Your connection to the elemental magic of earth allows you to extend its mystical protection to you and your allies. Beginning at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to expend 3 sorcery points and grant an aegis of protective earth magic to one creature you touch, including possibly yourself. The creature gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a creature hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the attacker and make one melee weapon attack against them. You can teleport in this way only if you and the attacker are on the same surface. If you use this ability to grant a protective aegis to another creature, the effect immediately ends for the first creature.</p>
