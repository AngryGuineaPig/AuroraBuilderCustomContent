			<p>Your improved control over the elemental waters that fuel your power improves your Curse of the Depths. Starting at 14th level, when you reduce the movement speed of a creature to 0 with your Curse of the Depths feature, you can force the creature to make an (additional) Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is covered in elemental ice and is restrained until the start of your next turn. A creature can use an action to scrape the ice off the target, ending the restrained condition early.</p>
