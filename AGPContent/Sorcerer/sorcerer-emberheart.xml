			<p>You have been touched by primordial fire. Did you receive this power as a gift from a noble Efreeti, or were you born near a rift leading to the elemental plane of fire? This ember of primal flame within you may manifest in your outward appearance or through your emotions. Most Emberheart sorcerers revel in their exotic appearance; flame red hair, eyes like glowing embers, or dark skin with magma peering through cracks. Is your flaming soul a raging inferno, unable to be controlled, or, do you seek to master your power?</p>
