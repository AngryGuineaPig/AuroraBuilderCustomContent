			<p>Druids of the Circle of the Dragon devote themselves to the natural balance of all dragons, good and evil. Some are fanatics obsessed with obtaining draconic power, while others worship beings such as Bahamut or Tiamat in a quest to gain a divine ascension. Wherever they go, these druids bear with them a flaming passion and extraordinary pride.</p>

			<p>Starting at 6th level, when you wild shape, your each creature of your choice within 10 feet must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Druid spell save DC or become frightened for 1 minute.

			<p class="indent"><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Draconic, Primordial</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Challenge:</strong> 5</p>
			<br />
			<p class="indent"><strong>Elemental Nature.</strong> The druidic dragon sleeps but doesn't require air, food, or drink.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Environmental Camouflage.</strong> While the druidic dragon remains motionless with its limbs and appendages tucked close to its body, it resembles a natural formation. A creature within 30 feet of it can discern its true nature with a successful Intelligence (Nature) check against your druid spell save DC.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Empowered Attacks.</strong> The druidic dragon’s attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of bypassing resistance and immunity to nonmagical weapons.</p>
			<h5 style="text-decoration:underline">Actions</h5>
			<br/>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The druidic dragon makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its tail.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>:  +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>:  +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>:  +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The druidic dragon exhales destructive energy. Each creature in the area of exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by the druidic dragon's draconic essence, against your druid spell save DC. A creature takes 35 (10d6) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<h5 style="text-decoration:underline">Reactions</h5>
			<br/>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Frightful Reveal.</em></strong> When a creature that is unaware of the druidic dragon's presence is within 30 feet of it, the druidic dragon can use its reaction to frightfully reveal itself in its true nature. Each creature of its choice within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC or become frightened for 1 minute.</p>
