			<p>At 2nd level, once per turn when you damage a creature you can see with a spell, you can choose to have the creature become Radioactive. A Radioactive creature emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius around them. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being invisible. A Radioactive creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns or take 1d6 radiant damage. On a success ending the effect is ended.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a Radioactive creature within 30 ft of you makes a Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength saving throw you may use your reaction to weaken them further. Roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll.</p>
