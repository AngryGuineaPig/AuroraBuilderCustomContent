			<p>The Dark Thralls technique was created by a cultivator who used the ki in her body to control the shadows of others. Her prowess was such that affected enemies often found themselves savaged by their own shades. Users of this technique fit well into support and offensive roles, using controlled shadows as effectively as any weapon.</p>
