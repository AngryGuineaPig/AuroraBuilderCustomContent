			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn to utilize your aura to create physical ammunition. As a part of each of your attacks, you may summon an arrow or bolt to attack with. This ammunition is magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and deals 2d4 force damage. This ammunition requires a ranged 2-handed weapon to shoot. The ammunition’s damage die increases to 2d6 at level 10. It dematerialises upon hitting or missing a target, and making one when another exists causes the older one to disappear, unless stated otherwise.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you ready an attack, the ammunition does an extra 1d10 damage. It is lost if it is not shot by the end of your next turn, and the extra damage is wasted.</p>
