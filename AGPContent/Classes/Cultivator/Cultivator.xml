		<description>
		<p>A dwarf flexes his fingers as the newest weapon disappears inside his core. Delighted by the prospect of mastering these new arms, he summons the weapon to his hands as he rises to charge his sparring partner. The hammer connects, knocking the opponent back and off balance, only to be instantly assaulted by the blades that replace the hammer in a flash.</p>
		<p class="indent">While her enemies pour into the room to surround her, the elf calmly prepares her next move with energy crackling between her hands. When the moment is right, she vanishes in a burst of lightning. Her befuddled foes don’t realize that she’s now standing in the entrance behind them until she unleashed waves of electricity back into the chamber.</p>
		<p class="indent">An orc drops from the roof, rolling with the fall to come back up running. Heading towards his companions, he can see they are blissfully unaware of the sorcerer preparing something devastating behind them. He throws his shield at the sorcerer and connects, buying him more time to arrive behind his party to generate a large shield of light and part the sea of fire that spews forth from the caster.</p>
		<p class="indent">Cultivators are those who would learn powerful techniques to further their strength. They see every fight as an opportunity to grow, and every enemy is a treasure trove of experience waiting to be plundered. A cultivator often seeks physical perfection in themselves and their techniques.</p>
		<h4>A Foundation of Ki</h4>
		<p>Ki is a fundamental force that resides in all living and non-living things. Cultivators have learned ways to gather this power and accumulate it in an internal reservoir that they call their ‘foundation’. Drawing from this Ki reserve, they can perform secret techniques to create supernatural effects.</p>
		<p class="indent">These techniques may have been passed on to a cultivator by an instructor or they may have learned it from an ancient manual. In rare cases, they might have even created one by themselves. Acquiring their technique is a significant event for a cultivator, as they will most likely be drawn to honing and perfecting it for the rest of their lives.</p>
		<h4>Pursuit of Perfection</h4>
		<p>"Civilize the mind, but make savage the body." Cultivators strive to grow their foundation to the highest peaks and to break through barriers in their cultivation as quickly as possible. This pursuit drives them towards combat, as the knowledge and experience gained in battle is crucial for their progress. Their single-minded pursuits cause many cultivators to live on their own, eschewing the crowds and comforts of city life. At the same time, cultivators readily join adventuring groups to meet their needs for combat, wealth and materials – all in service of further honing their craft.</p>
		<h4>CREATING AN ARCANE ARMSMAN</h4>
		<p>When creating a cultivator think about your characters background and their motivation. Becoming a cultivator is a path that takes dedication. Why is your character so dedicated to growing stronger? An unfortunate event? A role model? How did your character begin to learn their respective technique? Were they taught at a dojo with others, or under a master alone? It could even be as simple as a manuscript found in ruins.</p>
		<p class="indent">What your cultivator is searching for, whether it be looming near or in the far future, can be important. Simple or not, something drives a cultivator to continue on their painful and arduous journey.</p>
		<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
		<p>You can make a cultivator quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on your choice of weapon, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the Far Traveler Background.</p>
