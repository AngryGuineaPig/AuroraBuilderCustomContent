	<p><i>A burly human wrestles an Owlbear into submission barehanded.</i></p>
	<p class="indent"><i>A half-orc bedecked in shining gold plate strikes down her fifth opponent to the jeers of the audience.</i></p>
	<p class="indent"><i>A halfling wielding a net and trident dashes in for the finishing blow against a captive ogre, and the crowd goes wild.</i></p>
	<p>These are Gladiators, warriors that not only fight well, but look good doing it. To a Gladiator, the performance is just as important as the battle prowess. They strive to not only be the best fighter on the field, but also to be the best looking fighter out there. Those who are truly talented can merge the two, and achieve incredible results.</p>
	<h4>Love of the Crowd</h4>
	<p>Rather than striving for martial perfection or defending a homeland against invaders, Gladiators pursue a much loftier motivation: the adoration of fans. For a Gladiator, renown comes from fame, and it is a desire for that recognition that drives them to be inventive and resourceful on the battlefield. Though they deal in combat, a true Gladiator is a performer at heart.</p>
	<p class="indent">This does not mean every Gladiator in the world is greedy or vain --- many use their artful prowess to make a statement. Perhaps they see themselves as a champion of the people, a commoner who has risen to acclaim through their skill. Or perhaps they relish the joy they bring people with their performances. The true motivation of a Gladiator varies, but their ultimate goal demands time in the limelight. A Gladiator is best on the front lines, demonstrating impossible feats that no one else would ever dare perform. They train hard to be sure that they are the best in the field, and their artful flourishes are spectacles unto themselves.</p>
	<p class="indent">This doesn't mean that a Gladiator cannot be a team player, though --- leaving an opponent stunned by the sheer audacity of an attack can give one of their allies a fantastic opening to strike!</p>
	<h4>Storied Showmen</h4>
	<p>Not every pit fighter or back alley pugilist is a Gladiator. Gladiators are the most distinguished in their fields, rising to greatness in and out of the arenas and fairgrounds. Being a talented fighter is far from enough to be a successful Gladiator. Those combatants who simply defeat their opponents will be doomed to tougher and tougher challenges, until they're pitted against something that breaks them. Far too many straight-laced warriors have grunted through a series of powerful combatants, only to meet their end in a fight that was all but rigged.</p>
	<p class="indent">To survive the arena, a Gladiator needs style and flair. Winning the favor of the crowd means survival, and a better chance of being in fights that are possible to win. Gladiators know this, and use it to their advantage. Most of them are talented warriors that know how to sweep a leg or disarm an opponent. Their talent lies in doing so by sending their opponent sprawling with an arcing kick, or making their opponent's weapon fly clear across the field.</p>
	<h4>CREATING A GLADIATOR</h4>
	<p>Gladiators who leave the arena to pursue a life of adventure do so for many different reasons. Consider what your character's motivation for leaving behind a life of fame might be. Perhaps they're bored of the trials they face in the arena, and are looking for glory in the more untamed parts of the world. Perhaps they were fighting to earn their freedom, and now want to see the world. Or perhaps they're simply on a tour to garner more fans!</p>
	<p>When creating your Gladiator, consider both what brought you to the arena, and why you left it. No matter what, at some point you entered the arena, and your time there will shape your future.</p>
	<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
	<p>You can create a Gladiator quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score. Your next highest skill should be Charisma. Second, choose the Soldier background.</p>
