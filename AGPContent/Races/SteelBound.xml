			<p>Forced to become a facsimile of their lives, those that sacrifice their flesh for metal are on a path not many would dream of. They are often killed on the battlefield before their time, and their soul binds itself to the armour they wear.</p>
			<h4>Steel-Bound Names</h4>
      		<p>A steel bounds name is often based off their old name, often with metal or armor relation thrown in.</p>
			<p><strong>Names:</strong> Plate, Steel, Iron, Rust, Chain, Don, Shield, Scale</p>
			<h4>Steel-Bound Traits</h4>
			<p>As a Steel-Bound you gain the following traits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your constitution increases by 1</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> As a being of metal Steel-Bound are not affected by time, their armour will often weather over time giving the illusion of age however there is no overall effect to the soul.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Steel-Bound will tend to vary in alignment based of the subrace they belong to. Jagged will tend towards chaotic and slightly evil, Forge minds towards neutral and Ironsouls towards Lawful Good.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Though armour varies in size, Steel-Bound are medium creatures.</p>
