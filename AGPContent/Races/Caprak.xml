			<h4>THE EXPERIMENT OF THE MAD WIZARD</h4>
 			<p>Caprak are the result of a twisted experiment by a mad elf wizard. They were used as a slave force for him while he researched ways to become immortal inside his facility in the middle of the forest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For years they endured the abuses of their master until one day when they revolted. During the fight many caprak where killed but they finally killed their master with improvised spear.</p>
			<h4>LOOKING FOR A PLACE IN THE WORLD</h4>
 			<p>After breaking free of their master, they were found by elven guards and taken to the capital to decide their fate by the council of elders. After much deliberation both in favor of letting the caprak free or eliminating them for being considered an aberration. Finally an elf life cleric, named Thiala Firhael convinced the majority of the council to let the caprak leave.</p>
			<p class="indent">Guided by the young elf and fearing a change of heart by the council, the caprak headed towards the neighboring human kingdom, that was tolerant enough to let the settle in. Thankful for the divine intervention that saved them and the tolerance showed by the humans they became quite religious and loyal to the gods and the new kingdom they were now part of.</p>
