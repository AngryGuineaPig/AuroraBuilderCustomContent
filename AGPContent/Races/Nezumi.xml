		<description>
      <p>The Nezumi, or "ratlings" as they are often called by humans, as a race of bipedal ratlike humanoids. They are an ancient race that, before their fall, lived in grand cities in a mighty empire. On an apocalyptic day Nezumi legend dubs "The Terrible Day when Air became Fire and Heaven Fell From Its Perch to Crush Our Glorious Home Beneath its Blackened Corpse," the empire of ratlings was destroyed and the region known to them as the Shadowlands was born. In the aftermath of that event, the ratlings have become hardy and wily scavengers, eking out a meager existence in the midst of the land's greatest horrors.</p>
			<h4>Life as a Ratling</h4>
			<p>Nezumi look like nothing so much as humanoid rats. They stand upright at similar heights to humans, with prominent teeth, ears and snouts. Their bodies are often covered in grey rough fur. They are wild and fierce, they have natural instincts to scavenge and protect each other fiercely.</p>
			<h4>Names</h4>
      <p>Nezumi names are often 3-5 syllables, consisting of guttural chokes, clicks and other harsher noises often separated by apostrophe. Oh- can be added when a Nezumi is given the title of teacher or holder of great knowledge. The ending of their names are their clan names and if one is of a high standing in the clan Ti- is added before the clan name. Nezumi often adopt nicknames for other creatures to refer to them by.</p>
