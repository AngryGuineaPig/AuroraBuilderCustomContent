      		<p>Ikwiikwii resemble bipedal owls with no wings and taloned hands. Some suspect they are a variant from the first owlbears who were selected at a smaller size. They are still stocky, sharing their larger cousins muscular build</p>
			<p>Ikwiikwii prefer mountains and boreal forests, but they are hardy and capable hunters, and some live in the most barren of deserts. Rarely farmers most Ikwiikwii share an owlbears fury in combat and pride themselves on their hunting abilities.</p>
			<p>Ikwiikwii mate for life as a general rule, and their families rarely exceed four individuals at a time. If a family grows too large the eldest child is encouraged to leave the nest and start their own families. The moment that the eldest leaves is when they become an adult, often being a great celebration where they are showered with gifts.</p>
			<p>Ikwiikwii are shy, cautious and slow to trust, however their trust is a strong bond that they make with people.</p>
