			<h4>Physical Description</h4>
			<p>Argiles are humanoid beings made from clay. Their material and method of construction are the same to that of golems, yet Argiles seem to have been built more closely to human proportion. Argiles are hollow and can break easily when putting under much force. The Hebrew letters carved into head read "emet", meaning "truth". Some legends have said that an Argile is killed by removing the first letter, making the word spell "met", meaning "dead". Otherwise, they may be able to live forever, though no one is certain. The mouth, nose, and eyes on an Argile are merely decoration, yet Argiles are still able to see, hear, smell, and speak. The mouth orifice never opens on its own without breaking the clay.</p>
