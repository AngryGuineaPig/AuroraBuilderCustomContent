		<description>
      <p>Living dolls are a rare race of small humanoid constructs created by powerful mages from ordinary dolls. A few of these dolls have ended up on the material plane, however due to their arcane and therefore unnatural nature and often unnerving visages and voices they are seen as bad luck or evil by many who come across them.</p>
			<h4>PRETTY LITTLE THINGS</h4>
			<p>Living Dolls appear simply as dolls. They are small figures with the likeness of humans. Living dolls are typically made from dolls of very high quality, possessing a large level of detail making them even creepier to most. They are still obviously artificial as often their details are easy to pick out as different from a normal creature. Their eyes are glossy and often made from fragile glass. These eyes are often slightly too large and the pupils are not dark enough. Their skin is often smooth without texture due to the materials they are made of.</p>
			<h4>AN ARTIFICIAL BIRTH</h4>
      <p>Living dolls are created by binding souls to dolls and weaving life into them. Living dolls can only be created by the most powerful of mages who border on ascension to either godhood or lichdom. The motivation for creating one differs from person to person, a servant, a friend, or built to resemble and mimic a long lost friend or loved one. Though the dolls are often unaware of the reason behind their creation.</p>
      <h4>Living Doll Names</h4>
      <p>Living dolls often have names given by their creators, based off names the creator liked or people that the creator knew.</p>
