            <p>At 14th level, your anger is like a chamber of pressure in a volcano, ready to explode out at any moment. When you enter a rage, any creatures within 15ft of you must make a dexterity save with a DC of 8+ your proficiency modifier + your constitution modifier. On a failure, the creature takes 6d6 + your constitution bonus fire damage and is pushed 10ft away. On a success, they take half as much and aren't pushed.</p>
