            <p>Barbarians that follow this path use their rage to push through the damage of magic and resist its effects. After all, if some creatures can use their minds to affect the barbarian, then the barbarian can use their minds to ignore those effects. The Path of Antimagic is a simple one, headed straight through whatever magics might try and stand in your way.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, not even magical trickery can stop you. While raging, your speed by magic and any magical effects that would paralyse or petrify you instead causes the effects of the slow spell. Additionally, if you are frightened by a spell, willingly moving towards the source counts a difficult terrain.</p>

            <p>At 14th level, you begin to draw magic towards you to snuff it out. If a creature within 10ft of you is targeted by a spell, you can use your reaction to force the spell to target you. If the spell requires an attack roll it is made with disadvantage, if it requires a saving throw it is made with advantage.</p>
