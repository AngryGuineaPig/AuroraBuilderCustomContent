            <p>At 14th level, you can become what you are emulating. When you move 10ft in any straight line during a single turn whilst raging you can become a lightning bolt. You instantly travel 30ft in a straight line. The transformation removes the grappled or restrained conditions, and the instant movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. At the end of this movement you return to your original form and all creatures around you must make a constitution save (DC = 8 + proficiency + constitution modifier) or take 1d6 + half your barbarian level thunder damage. On a success the target takes half damage.</p>
