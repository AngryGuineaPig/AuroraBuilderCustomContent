		<description>
			<p>Mystical tattoos are an ancient form of magic that  imparts bearers with extraordinary gifts. They can  be seen on any creature willing to allow magic to be  embedded deeper into their being than ever before.</p>
			<p class="indent">A tattoo’s magical properties are born of their magically imbued designs, often a testament to the original tattooist’s expertise. A great example of this is a special variant of magic tattoos known as spellbangers, smaller designs replicating arcane spellcasting, restricted to the same tattooist that created them.</p>
			<p class="indent">Magic tattoos are imbued with power by their creators. While sketching, tattooists  their magics directly into the ink of their design.</p>
			<p class="indent">The design is layered with intent, serving as both pathway and instructions for the tattooist’s magic. This can be an impossible task for those inexperienced in the tattooists’ method. In a process that takes just a few seconds after the design’s completion, the magic blooms within the design, and it acquires its intended effect or property.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">ALTERNATIVE TATTOO SYSTEM</h5>
			<p>The practice adopted by tattooists for distributing their magic tattoos is simple and permits them to benefit from their work, while still allowing for tattoos to be widely accessible. Magic tattoos are initially sketched within the pages of an enchanted sketchbook by a tattooist. After the design is drawn on an enchanted sketchbook page, any individual may extract that tattoo into an empty needle using tattooist’s tools. This allows designs to be more easily distributed or acquired. The page is empty once the design is extracted, but a special needle is now ready to be applied.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creator’s whims often drive the initial design, but this can be steered by other individuals requiring a particular result. Some would say that this is what sets magic tattoos apart from other magic items. The degree of control that tattooists have over their designs while applying their artistry and magics often yields truly remarkable results, limited only by their skill and imagination.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TATTOOIST’S TOOLS</h5>
			<p>The tattooist’s tools are a type of artisan’s tools consisting of two main components - the hammer and chisel. The chisel contains a simple mechanism that can twist to clasp onto needles of various widths. The hammer can act as an activator when it strikes the chisel, temporarily applying a magnetic property unique to magically-imbued inks into the needle.</p>
			<p class="indent">One of the main uses of tattooist’s tools in regards to magic tattoos is extraction. An individual holds the chisel affixed with an empty needle against an enchanted sketchbook page or skin upon which a magic tattoo is applied. The wielder then taps the opposite end of the chisel, drawing the tattoo design inside of the affixed, empty needle.</p>
			<p class="indent">The tattooist’s tools also include plenty of needles and medical supplies for sterilization. This is necessary in case the tattooist’s tools are used to apply mundane tattoos as well. For non-magical tattoo applications, the chisel’s needle can be dipped into the appropriate pigments and then hammered against an individual’s skin, scales, or feathers to ink a tattoo.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">APPLICATION &amp; ATTUNEMENT</h5>
			<p>Applying a magic tattoo from a needle simply requires that the special needle be held against one’s skin. A magic tattoo counts towards the number of magic items to which a creature can attune.</p>
			<p class="indent">The design slowly flows from the needle into the skin upon contact, molding itself to suit the individual’s body. An applied tattoo appears as it did on its sketchbook page, retaining the visual properties of the ink used when it was sketched. In this way, the design transitions from page to person through a needle.</p>
			<p class="indent">For unusual skin types, the tattoo will often take on a different form. As an example, a creature covered in fur or feathers might witness the tattoo take shape as markings as it leaves the needle. A creature with a metallic exterior might see the tattoo engrave itself onto their shell. As a tattoo is simply another form of magic item, this can be interpreted as the attunement process.</p>
			<p class="indent">The process to end attunement to a magic tattoo is different from the process to end attunement to a normal magic item. A creature other than the one to whom the tattoo is applied must use tattooist’s tools and an empty needle to extract the tattoo from the skin, as it was once extracted from a tattooist’s sketchbook page.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">BIGGER ISN’T ALWAYS BETTER</h5>
			<p>While there is undoubtedly more beauty to admire in tattoos of increasing size and complexity, these factors often belie their true potential.</p>
			<p class="indent">A more pertinent factor to investigate when shopping for a new tattoo is the original intent behind its design and, of course, aesthetics. These factors will determine whether the tattoo suits its future bearer and whether the tattoo will work in harmony with their existing abilities. You will find that tattoos ranging drastically in rarity and power can be of the same proportion.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also of note, magic tattoos that are applied on the same body part can coexist. All magic tattoos can be layered upon each other, with individuals not having to fear for their properties being tainted or diminished. Magic tattoos are sketched with purpose, and are not so easily disrupted simply by their proximity to one other. In this case, an individual can mentally decide which tattoo sits at the forefront to make it so.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">PAIN &amp; DISMEMBERMENT</h5>
			<p>Although magic tattoos should initially be applied to a specific body part, the magic connects more intimately with the host as time progresses. In the event a tattoo is damaged or a body part lost, the tattoo retains its magical properties and will immediately shift to the next most appropriate part of the attuned individual’s body (GM’s choice)</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TATTOO PRICING</h5>
			<p>As one might imagine, each tattoo is unique and valued differently based on factors ranging from its functionality to its visual appeal. This can lead to some fluctuations in terms of pricing.</p>
			<p class="indent">One thing that remains constant is each tattooist’s knowledge of tattoo rarity, as rarity is tied to how difficult it was for them to gather the right components to sketch the tattoo in the first place. As a result, it is the most accurate determinant of tattoo price. Tattooists will often price within the range provided in the Magic Tattoos Price Guide table on the previous page, unless there are exceptional circumstances. As magic tattoos do not fade over time—whether in terms of power or appearance— their value does not fluctuate as they age.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another determining factor in pricing is the dimensions of the tattoo. It undeniably takes more time and effort to craft a larger tattoo, resulting in a slight bump in prices when it comes to purchasing tattoos that are to be applied on one’s chest or back.</p>
			<p class="indent">However, as a tattoo’s power and function do not correlate with its size, it often becomes a point of contention during sales. Less experienced tattooists have been haggled down on this point, being more artists than salespeople.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TATTOO AVAILABILITY</h5>
			<p>Another factor to keep in mind when browsing for magic tattoos is that the availability of certain designs will always be a complicated matter.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any tattooist will only be an expert in crafting a particular set of tattoo designs, and their stock will always reflect this.</p>
			<p class="indent">A practice many tattooists have adopted is trading wares among their shops. This allows for much more variety in merchandise within each establishment. A side effect of this is that you will still see many of the same tattoo designs if you are only visiting parlors within the same region.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is best to travel out of the area if your goal is to procure a wide and varied selection of mystical tattoos.</p>

				<p>This tattoo was developed during a brief war between two kingdoms as an accelerant for the training required by fledgling knights, doctors, mages, and vehicle operators. After the war ended, it was quickly adopted by prestigious guilds looking to boost their apprenticeship programs. Guilds often embedded their own iconography into the design, yielding more than a few unintended side-effects.</p>

				<p>This tattoo carries some taboo; it was historically used in common practice by spies, rogues, escorts, and those who rely on charming their quarry. When a nefarious guild started branding their underlings, the tattoo became associated with their minions and went out of fashion due to its limitations. In recent times, the tattoo has undergone a renaissance, newly associated with aristocrats and the leisure class as a glamour tool.</p>

				<p>This tattoo was created by a troupe of vampire worshiping performers known as The Sanguine Company. They sought to emulate the creatures of their admiration.

Within the area, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and magic items (other than the tattoo itself) become mundane. Any spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the storm or be cast through it. Until the effect ends, the storm moves with you, centered on you. Once used, the tattoo can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

				<p>This tattoo’s origins can be traced back to the Cult of the Unraveled, a group fixated on extinguishing magic users and unmaking the gods of magic. Their tattoo gave them a lethal edge in close-quarters combat against magic users and items. After quietly sowing dissent towards magic among the common folk, they conducted a joint strike against powerful mage guilds in several cities. The clashes were brutal, but the cult lost and was forcefully disbanded.</p>
				<p class="indent">So thoroughly did the mages quell the uprising that the tattoo has become nearly impossible to find.</p>

			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo is fashioned after a heavy crown once worn by a being that commanded terrible power.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can speak the tattoo’s command word, causing small globules of magical golden ink to leak from your tattoo and travel down your body onto your fingertips. For the next minute or until you use a bonus action to end this effect, any object you touch turns into solid gold until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you touch a creature, it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to gold. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. A creature petrified in this way must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or remain petrified. On a success, the creature is no longer petrified.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once used, the tattoo can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>

				<p>This tattoo was created by a powerful witch with a golden touch. She spent decades studying her innate abilities, trying to reproduce them in others.</p>

Eventually, the bard met their end against a group of unimpressed adventurers. The tattoo was repurposed by the adventurers for commanding people to behave and evacuate in an orderly manner during monster attacks. While effective at keeping people under duress alive, its use is considered controversial and dangerous by most.</p>

Countless miners often faced avoidable accidents in their line of work, most of which were a result of sudden loss of light or vision in tunnels.

Many believed she was blessed with divine insight and could see through the lies that other creatures told. She is said to have passed on her gift in the form of a tattoo towards the end of her life. The order only shares the tattoo with those that demonstrate their devotion to the truth through years of study and practice.</p>

				<p>An aged bard named Quid Rapine, having settled down after a lifetime of travel to collect his tales and fill his coffers, found that crowds in his hometown tired of hearing the same old sagas and songs.</p>
				<p class="indent">Though appreciative of the entertainment provided in their streets and taverns at first, the townsfolk soon grew disinterested in Quid’s tales. In response, Quid began to focus on a younger audience, knowing that children would bring their parents, and the parents, their purses. Unfortunately, the demands of entertaining children who constantly asked to hear the same songs and stories repeated ad nauseum was a wearying task.

				<p>Long ago, a ruthless red dragon pushed a village of humans to their breaking point with her incessant raids on their livestock. The villagers decided that they needed to bring the dragon down, regardless of how many lives would be lost in the process. Though half of them fell the day of the battle, the villagers celebrated as the dragon’s body was counted among the dead. Unable to find the dragon’s hoard, they instead harvested its body for various trophies. The creature’s horns found themselves in the possession of an apothecary who discovered that, if ground, they could be refined into a powder with interesting properties. It wasn’t long before a tattooist used this powder in designing a tattoo that allowed its wearer to breathe the fallen dragon’s deadly flames.</p>

				<p>Within the Volum kingdom, it was common knowledge that a number of illegitimate heirs were being sired by its unscrupulous rulers over the years, despite not a single one speaking out about their lineage. Eventually, rumors spread that all these unwanted offspring were actually gathered shortly after birth and sent to live in a monastery far from the capital. Later in life, they would be forced to take a vow of silence and celibacy so as to not threaten the crown, and they were also given a “gift” that would identify them immediately. This gift was a tattoo that was inked upon their throats, visible to all that crossed their path. The design did grant them the ability of great reach which would serve them well, though many would say, not at all a consolation for the lives they could have lived.</p>

Instead of devouring the child, they took pity on her and brought her to the oldest tree in the forest, where she was given a gift. A seed was placed in her mouth, where it sprouted vines that wrapped and twisted around her neck. Once set, they allowed her to feel the consciousness that flowed through all living things.

				<p>There was once a respected order of paladins whose members had become discouraged with the order’s hesitance to do battle and spill any blood. After months of vocal protests, the discontented members would eventually split into a separate faction. They focused their training and studies on dominating their opponents on the battlefield, with the goal of becoming the antithesis to their old acquaintances.</p>
				<p class="indent">The research of both the order and the new faction were discovered by a tattooist some time later, who was able to combine their discoveries into one fascinating tattoo.</p>

				<p>There once was weary ranger that collapsed beside a well-trodden path after months of traveling alone.</p>
				<p class="indent">There she dreamt, finding herself treading water in a stormy sea. Soon, the waves writhed and coiled into the shape of a giant serpent. The pangs of pain were vivid as the serpent bore its fangs and sunk them deep into her body. When she awoke, the ranger reached for her neck, finding it to be tender and sore. It was later in town that a tattooist glimpsed the interesting marking on the ranger’s neck, and worked it into their newest design.</p>

Consulting with their resident tattooist, they managed to conceive of a tattoo that would offer their members more opportunities to accomplish their missions in the light of day. It was a stroke of genius, and the design continues to gain traction among rogues to this day.</p>

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey.

				<p>This tattoo was first developed to allow adventurous druids the opportunity to explore the ocean depths.</p>
				<p class="indent">Eventually, it would grow in popularity among newer druids who would otherwise be restricted to exploring dry land. The versatility of the tattoo also meant plenty of interaction with a number of flora and fauna under the sea, advancing many druids’ studies and research. Many who used the tattoo in this way to advance their education would later attest that it definitely helped get their feet wet.</p>

On your turn, you can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the creature’s Strength (Athletics) check. If you win the contest, you can pull the creature within 5 feet of you. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, breaking free from your tongue and freeing a restrained creature on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the target is an object, your tongue instantly latches on or coils around it until you take a bonus action to release it. While you hold an object in this way, you can’t willingly move more than 20 feet from it. If you move more than 20 feet away from the object, it is released. If the object is not being carried, you can pull it straight into your hands. If the object is being carried by a creature, the creature can’t use the item but may continue to hold on to the item. While your tongue grasps an object that another creature is holding you can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the creature’s Strength (Athletics) check to pull the object out of their grasp and into your hands. The creature can also use an action on its turn to make a DC 15 Strength check, wresting the item free from your tongue on a success.</p>

				<p>This tattoo finds its origins in a joke made at the expense of a country’s incompetent politicians.</p>
				<p class="indent">Many of the countrymen had begun to openly proclaim their sitting officials to be “full of hot air”, disillusioned after many years of broken promises and increased taxation. The senators, fearful of civil unrest and unable to take a joke, had anyone who publicly opposed their views assassinated in the dead of night. Hearing of the manner in which the senators were dealing with those that talked ill of them, many began to hold their tongues in public.</p>
				<p class="indent">This tattoo was developed as a way to extricate braver members of the growing rebellion who refused to simply stay quiet—an escape through hot air.</p>

				<p>There was once a young sorcerer named Wonks who, having observed the practice of tattooing for some time, wanted to try her hand at creating her own design. She was focused on finding a way to become more durable in battle, considering that in her own party, Wonks was often the first to be targeted, and the first to fall. She would eventually create the first iteration of her design which she considered an absolute success. It would completely nullify the effect of enemy spells by turning its bearer into a colorful, translucent, sugary-sweet statue that repelled magic for one hour. Wonks’ party was forever torn on their opinion of her tattoo.</p>

				<p>This tattoo was originally conceived by a group of pious monks in their crusade against evildoers. The source of their power came from a watchful god, and it would manifest as a radiant beam of energy that was found to be potent against wayward souls. In time, a tattooist among their ranks found a way to turn this divine weapon into symbols that could be tattooed directly on a person. The monks were elated, as this meant that their god’s power could be summoned by all, regardless of their level of devotion, allowing many others to defend themselves from those of evil disposition.</p>

				<p>Brave scouts that would venture out ahead of their battalion to ensure that the lands were safe would be given this tattoo to apply. They would often have no knowledge of what they may encounter out on their own and when they might be able find a good place to stop and get a breather. Thankfully, this tattoo would allow the scouts to go long periods of time without rest or food to ensure the survival of their fellow soldiers.</p>

			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo symbolizes three perfect spheres.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can speak the tattoo’s command word to cause it to completely separate from your skin and surround you in an inky bubble for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">The bubble is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. You are able to see and hear outside your bubble, but other creatures are unable to see and hear inside your bubble. The atmosphere inside your bubble is comfortable and dry, and you are able to roll your bubble around up to half your walking speed. The bubble can be picked up and moved by other creatures.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass into, through, or out of the bubble, though a creature in the bubble can breathe there. The bubble is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the bubble damage anything outside it. A disintegrate spell targeting the bubble destroys it without harming anything inside it.</p>

				<p>Many protective magical properties granted by items are often short-lived, sometimes only lasting for a few seconds, or are out of reach for those that do not possess magical abilities to begin with. This tattoo was developed by an aspiring tattooist who sought to infuse longer-lasting protective magic directly onto one’s skin. He hoped that when activated, a person would find themselves in a tiny, mobile, spherical shield. Many a tale has since been told of people found guilty of some crime in their village manifesting a bubble and rolling away to evade punishment.</p>

				<p>This design has a dark history that many in the tattoo industry have tried to erase. There were rumors when it was first stocked that led some to believe applying the tattoo using the beak of an avian race known for their camouflage abilities improved its properties threefold. As a result, the creatures were ruthlessly hunted and harvested, along with other creatures that looked similar to them in order to meet the demand. Those that took to back alleys hoping to apply their “augmented” tattoo soon found that they were just cheated out of their money, and only ended up with infected wounds as a result of the misinformation.</p>

				<p>Long ago in a distant land, twin tailors were commissioned to fashion an exquisite garb by their emperor. The tailors instead chose to focus their efforts into designing a tattoo at the urging (and with the help) of a traveling tattooist, which could grant its bearer a number of clothing options limited only by their imagination. When presented with the design, the flamboyant emperor decided to hold a parade down the streets of his kingdom where he tested his fancy new tattoo. The spectacle of the event captivated the crowds, and the emperor giggled knowing that it was all an illusion—that he was in fact naked the entire time.</p>

				<p>When examined by a curious druid, she discovered that this tattoo actually had a secondary property that makes its bearer’s body secrete an interesting aroma. The aroma seemed to have an effect on other creatures’ minds. This meant that in addition to the tattoo’s ability to alter the magical defenses of whatever is in the vicinity of its bearer, it also altered their behavior in subtle ways if exposed too frequently to the tattoo’s aura. Whether those changes are permanent remain to be seen. The druid continues her research to this day.</p>

				<p>There was once an old witch who lived peacefully in her desert. One day, she was taken away and locked in a tall tower by an entitled princess and her royal guard. The princess had found the witch to be too repulsive and saw no other recourse. The tower room in which the witch was kept was many stories high and had windows that allowed the witch to see the beauty of the lands from which she was taken away.</p>
				<p class="indent">At the very least, she had been provided inks and other arts and crafts supplies to occupy her in her isolation. She used the inks to dabble in tattooing for a little while, later creating a potent design (thanks in part to her own magic) that allowed her to grow hair at an exponential rate. This eventually provided a means for her to climb down from her prison using some strong knots and a handy pair of scissors.</p>

				<p>There is a tale of a man who commissioned a portrait of himself that held magical properties. It would cause him to appear much younger, instead of the way he looked as the portrait was painted.</p>
				<p class="indent">Unfortunately, his cheeky artist made a last-minute addition—the portrait also seemed to reflect the depravity of the man’s character. One day, the man had enough of the creature staring back at him and took a knife to the portrait’s smug smile. The remains of the canvas were harvested for the inks and parchment that were believed to be hold the magic required for its clever illusion, many of which would eventually find their way into the hands of a pioneering tattooist.</p>

				<p>The idea for this tattoo was initially a suggestion voiced by worried alchemists as a way to prevent further loss of life that stemmed from their occupation’s volatile experiments. The ability to regenerate health was helpful, but the chance to survive accidents week after week was even more of a benefit. Unfortunately, the costs involved with producing even a single one of these tattoos far outweighed the combined revenue of many of those whose lives were extinguished in their pursuit of magical and scientific breakthroughs</p>

Once she discovered that many old shields harbored powerful enchantments anchored by markings and scripture, she immediately began to work on ways to incorporate them into tattoo designs. Her greatest work was replicating the magical enchantments imbued into a legendary shield passed down from hero to hero, known for protecting them against the most malevolent spellcasters in history.</p>

				<p class="indent">One day, after finishing a request for a bag with an interior far larger than it would appear to have from the outside, her patron refused to pay, knocking her to the ground and running off with the item clutched tightly in his arms. This incident affected the seamstress deeply, and she was never able to recreate the same item again due to the lingering trauma. Her partner, a tattooist, was able to replicate a similar effect within one of his designs years later, which did little to help the seamstress move on from her troubling memory, but contributed greatly to the global need for more portable storage solutions.</p>

				<p>There was once a young boy who enjoyed collecting rocks. One day, he found a piece of volcanic glass made up of twenty equal facets. Moments afterwards, a group of older boys approached and began to bully him. He wished that he was bigger and stronger than all of them, and was instantly transformed into a giant. The other boys ran away in fear, but soon returned with a crowd that carried pitchforks and bows. The boy then wished for a tougher skin to defend himself and found his skin turning to stone. The crowd, more frightened than ever, readied for attack. Anticipating this, the boy held the rock tight and wished to be the king, and as he changed in front of their eyes, he used his newfound confidence and appearance to convince them all to leave him be. Making one more wish, he asked for the rock to be bound to him forever. Years later, a historian who discovered a portrait of the king would bring the artwork to a mystical tattoo parlor—noticing a large mark upon the king’s chest.</p>

Though a howl came at the end of the shot, the hunter found nothing when she went to investigate, save for a patch of dark blood upon the grass. Having no ammunition left, the hunter returned home and slept. She was awoken in the middle of the night by a loud scraping at the door. Armed with her bow, she cautiously opened it. Again, she found nothing. As she bent low to investigate, a large creature caught her side and knocked her weapon away. She retreated into the cabin, slamming the door behind her. Without a weapon with which to defend herself, she found a bottle of poison and coated it all over her body. It was a long night, but soon the dawn came and she still drew breath. Years later, her daughter designed this tattoo, inspired by her mother’s harrowing tale and final attempt at defending herself.</p>

				<p>This tattoo was commissioned by a pirate airship crew to help facilitate air-to-ground docking and raids. No stranger to heights, this crew would free-fall with ropes trailing behind them from the ship and activate their tattoos as close to the ground as possible, allowing them to quickly and quietly drop out of thin air on unsuspecting travelers. As the design has spread, other uses have emerged, such as insurance for climbers fearful of plummeting off of mountains.</p>

Tired of being caught off guard by their unpredictable magics, he set out to create a tattoo that would nullify their magical effects. He wasn’t aware of the explosive side-effects of this until later, when he nullified a tattoo’s effect and blew up his pet parrot in the process.

				<p>This tattoo was created by an old man who spent his life dedicated to the exaltation of avian beings. After a long life lived simply observing the creatures, he eventually sought to fly among them. It is said that the avians taught him the tattoo’s design and that after it was applied, he took to the skies and never let his feet touch the earth ever again.</p>

			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo represents the delicate state of time and space.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you speak the tattoo’s command word and briefly stop the flow of time for yourself and one other creature you can see within 30 feet. An unwilling creature can make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the effect fails. On a failure, both you and the creature become frozen in time for 1 minute. No time passes for you and the creature, while all other creatures can use actions and move as normal. This effect ends on both of you if either you, or the creature frozen in time with you, are affected by any actions, environmental effects, or effects created by a creature moving as normal (GM’s discretion). Once used, the tattoo can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

				<p>This tattoo was created by a pair of lovers that wanted to escape from the intense stress that had encroached upon their lives. In a way, they succeeded. The tattoo stopped time for the both of them and no one else. Unfortunately, the first iteration they created worked indefinitely— trapping the lovers in a loving embrace. Much later, interested researchers were able to piece together a more practical version that could only freeze time temporarily.</p>

Any willing creature within the light can choose to take 1d6 radiant damage at the start of each of its turns. For each creature that does so, your ball of light gains one charge. All charges vanish once the ball of light is thrown or disappears.</p>

She shared this ability with a select few of her peers in the form of a tattoo.</p>

However, at the end of a chaotic battle between two kingdoms, Benne was struck by an errant arrow and killed. Unwilling to bear the loss and struck by divine inspiration, Soma burned a magical tattoo into her flesh at that moment to bind Benne’s spirit to her own. Together, they shared one body.

				<p>This tattoo was privately commissioned by a to-be folk hero that went by the name of the Silver Shepherd. They would coat themselves head-to-toe in grey paint and venture across the countryside, defending sheep from wolves, cliffs, and other potential hazards. The tattoo empowered them to travel much faster than a normal person, bounding across the sky in great leaps, as long as they were careful to land before the magic wore off. Unfortunately, they weren’t particularly good at calculations and one day miscalculated while helping a herd of sheep avoid a cliff. After their unfortunate demise, it’s been difficult to find tattooists willing to share the design.</p>

Over the course of many years and many failed experiments, they were able to wire the tattoo’s magic in a way that would allow a creature to push its body beyond its limits.

				<p>A tattooist once found herself alone and clinging to life in the mountains after her airship crash landed during a storm. She awoke in the company of nomads, who proceeded to nurse her back to health.</p>
				<p class="indent">During her time among them, she picked up two things—a handful of their delicious recipes and a new style of fighting. One of the style’s techniques allowed the horde’s more experienced warriors to slice through flesh as though it were nothing with their bare hands. She was not able to master this technique herself, even after months of training in their care, but was later able to design a tattoo that imitated the ability.</p>

				<p>Nobility in the land of Groja would often retain pheasants, peacocks, and other “beautiful” animals on their land as a symbol of their status, which naturally invited the attention of poachers. This tattoo was commissioned by some poachers in order to avoid the use of traditional nets which could be broken and left behind during a poacher’s foray onto a noble’s estate, arousing suspicion. This, among many other tactics, led to the nobility losing many of their prized beasts.</p>

Weary of standing up from her desk, she opted to conceive of a design that would allow her to do everything she needed to do from the comfort of her workstation.

			<p class="indent">As an action, you can speak the tattoo’s command word and touch an object that you can carry in one hand, for 10 minutes, bonding that object to yourself. This bond ends when you die or when you bond to another object.</p>
			<p class="indent">While this tattoo is applied on your skin, if the bonded object is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that object as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>

				<p>It is believed by many that this tattoo was created for a delusional old emperor as a way for him to retain his most prized possessions after he passed on into the afterlife. Surprisingly, days after the emperor’s death, many of his belongings did disappear from his palace, though many historians claim this was the work of nimble thieves rather than something supernatural.</p>

				<p>There is a tale of a knight and a paladin that happened to share the same road one afternoon. The knight began to talk about his adventures, the beasts he had slain and all the villages he had saved. He even rolled up his sleeve, displaying this impressive tattoo, a reward for one of his heroic exploits.</p>
				<p class="indent">Expecting to hear similar stories from the paladin, he was disappointed when they remained silent. The knight pressed the paladin to speak, remarking that surely a paladin had similar tales of heroism and bravery. To this, the paladin replied, “I just smite”.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo represents unbreakable shackles.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can speak the tattoo’s command word to cause inky chains and shackles to shoot out from your arms at a Large or smaller creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become bound by the shackles for the next hour, or until you use a bonus action to dismiss them. The shackles are as long as the distance between you and the creature at the time it was shackled. A creature can use its action to make a DC 20 Strength check, freeing a bound creature on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">When either you or the creature moves beyond the distance allowed by the shackle chains, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the other creature’s Strength (Athletics) check. Until the end of the current turn, when the winner of the contest moves, it can drag the shackled creature with it, but its speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes small than it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once used, this tattoo can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tether.</em></strong> You can use an action while a creature is bound by your shackles to transfer your tattoo to an object, transferring your side of the shackles in the process. If the shackled creature can’t move the object to which it is bound, it can use its action to make a DC 20 Strength check, breaking the chain on a success. If the chain is broken, the tattoo returns to your skin, wherever you are.</p>

If you spend one hour in meditation, a segment of your tattoo separates from your skin and enters the weapon, doubling the damage dice of the weapon and making it magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance. For example, a shortsword would deal 2d6 piercing damage instead of 1d6 piercing damage.</p>

				<p>Blacksmith’s guilds have long been in place to ensure the quality of the craft and to pass down generations of earned knowledge. However, in recent years, there has been a push for this knowledge to be made publicly accessible, as opposed to guarded behind the guilds’ heavily-fortified doors. In response, a bold young tattooist infiltrated and secured a coveted manuscript from a storied smith’s guild, and proceeded to render a design that was sure to anger more than a few old blacksmiths.</p>

				<p>The creator of this design credits an unruly bard as the sole inspiration. The bard known as Yuri, regularly resorted to ruthlessly berating and insulting both his allies and enemies (with musical accompaniment), to the point where they were unable to focus in battle. Some were even said to have broken down in tears, shedding their weapons along with their will to fight. One particularly perturbed survivor later sketched the tattoo, picturing the bard’s smug mug during the entire process.</p>

				<p>This tattoo was very popular among villagers in the far south that repeatedly found themselves repelling attacks by vampires and werecreatures on their homes. The assailants’ resistance to traditional weapons proved especially problematic during these encounters. The tattoo’s mystical properties would eventually give the villagers the small edge they needed to keep the hostile creatures at bay and defend themselves. Of course, the tattoo initially had more practical applications, such as to help supplement a dwindling ink supply.</p>

			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo represents the banners of a popular hero known to be too friendly for their own good.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Wallwalker.</em></strong> As an action, you can speak the tattoo’s command word to cause it to expand upwards along your body to cover all your limbs.</p>

				<p>This tattoo was created by a carnival artist that specialized in horror shows. They paired the tattoo with a terrifying costume, pretending to be a nightmarish creature that skittered unnaturally along walls and ceilings. The show was a hit with crowds and the carnival let attendees pay for their own nonmagical copies of the tattoo. The souvenir tattoo’s popularity eventually spurred many tattooists to recreate the magical design for their own parlors, eager to capitalize on its success.</p>

			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo represents a discordant sound piercing through the silence.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can speak the tattoo’s command word and cause it to emit a high frequency sound in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each creature within the sphere must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 6d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute.

				<p>Inspired by the piercing high notes of opera singers, this tattoo design was conceived by a gifted tattooist and opera lover for a robber (whom he insists he did not know was a criminal). The robber would go on to break many glass displays and cabinets holding valuable items in the jewelry stores and museums they snuck into. They successfully conducted several high-profile robberies before dropping off from the public eye completely.</p>

			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo represents the shattering of locks.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can use your feet to strike an object within 5 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a nonmagical means that prevents access. A target that is held shut by a lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked. Once used, this property of the tattoo can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

				<p>The tales about where this design originated are plentiful, but the prevailing theory is that the tattoo was created by a forgetful young man that got tired of accidentally locking himself out of his home.</p>
				<p class="indent">To remedy this, he created a tattoo that would simply unlock his door without the need for him to remember his key. It wasn’t until he accidentally walked into a closed store that he realized he had inadvertently designed a tattoo that could open any lock. Unfortunately, this revelation came much too late and he was still dragged to court for breaking and entering.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spin Cycle.</em></strong> As an action, you can lift your foot and direct the full force of one of your waterspouts at a creature you can see within 10 feet of you.

				<p>This design was created by a tattooist named Korra Ramani who found herself stranded on an island with just her equipment and enough emergency supplies to last a few days.

The local tattooist, also the celebrant’s mother, had run out of party favors and mistakenly applied an experimental but harmless (or so they assumed) tattoo they had designed. This was done in consultation with the child’s parents who assumed it was a tattoo that would temporarily allow their child to walk on water. Needless to say, the child was not able to walk on water.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points or fewer, but would not kill you outright, you do not fall unconscious. Instead, you fall prone and can take your next turn as normal. At the end of your next turn, you fall unconscious unless you have 1 or more hit points. If you take damage after this property is triggered, but before the end of your next turn, you gain one failed saving throw when you fall unconscious as a result of ending your turn with 0 hit points.

				<li>When you hit a creature with a whip created with the blood rose tattoo, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. At the start of each of its turns while it is poisoned in this way, it takes 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage it takes on subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poisoned condition ends after the creature succeeds on this saving throw 3 times.

				<p>There once lived a rogue name Esteban Gil, who had a habit of robbing the homes of extravagant spellcasters. He would tell his acquaintances that these targets always brought home and stashed away precious magical loot without any thought for security. The only problem Esteban ran into was if the homeowner happened to be home at the time of his raids. Over the course of his career, Esteban had been turned into a serpent, had his pants burnt off, and had his left foot exchanged with his right for almost a year. It took many requests and more than a few gold pieces, but a determined tattoo artist eventually managed to craft the right design for Esteban’s daggers. One that rendered his targets a little less “magical” and a little more willing to part with their belongings during the little rogue’s visits.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo was designed through divine inspiration in honor of the Harvest Deity, Shuri.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Tattoo.</em></strong> You can only attune to this tattoo if you are attuned to no more than one other magic item. If you attune to more than one other magic item while you are attuned to this tattoo, your attunement to this tattoo immediately ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">While this tattoo is applied on your skin, you are resistant to acid and poison damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can manifest a dreaded scimitar known as Putol whose blade never dulls. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You are proficient with this weapon, which ignores resistance to slashing damage. Putol deals slashing damage equal to 1d10 plus your ability modifier on a hit. While holding this weapon, you also ignore difficult terrain. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the scimitar.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Savage Garden.</em></strong> As an action, you can stab the scimitar into the ground at your feet to cause aggressive weeds and vines to sprout in a 30-foot radius around you. For the next minute, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. A Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in this area or enters the area for the first time on a turn, must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the effect ends. A creature can use its action to make a DC 17 Strength check, freeing a creature restrained by these plants on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the start of each of your turns, each creature restrained by your plants must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 piercing damage from their thorns as the plants further entangle the creature. After the effect ends, the plants calm, ending their restraining effects but remaining in place for the next year. Once used, this property of the tattoo can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bloody Harvest.</em></strong> When you attack a creature that has at least one limb with the scimitar and roll a 19 or 20 on the attack roll (before modifiers), the creature takes an extra 4d8 slashing damage and you cut off one of the creature’s limbs. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its limb to be cut off with this weapon. Additionally, you regain hit points equal to half the extra damage.</p>

				<p>Long ago, the peaceful village of Yule became the target of bandits, with crops and livestock routinely pillaged and destroyed. Unequipped and untrained, the village could not defend itself against these fiends, so it turned to Shuri, goddess of the land and harvest.</p>
				<p class="indent">In a township not far away, a tattooist’s young apprentice began having visions of a divine lady, with swirling lines across her body. She whispered the name of the village again and again, until the apprentice could no longer resist the pull of the goddess. The apprentice severed ties with her master, who vehemently forbade her from leaving.</p>
				<p class="indent">After reaching the village and learning of their plight, the apprentice immediately unpacked her tools and set to work, the divine lady’s markings etched clearly in her mind. The village chief took on the tattoo as soon as it was finished and dealt with the bandits swiftly when they came again to raid. The apprentice left to continue her training elsewhere, but returned many years later to set up shop among her friends.</p>

			<p class="indent">Creatures also have disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect your presence.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can manifest a flexible javelin known as Maginat that is almost weightless in your hands. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, with which you are proficient. Instead of a javelin’s usual damage, Maginat deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus your ability modifier on a hit. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the javelin.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Call of the Wild.</em></strong> You can summon fey spirits to aid you, each of which is shrouded in glowing symbols resembling your tattoo. As an action, you can cast the spell conjure woodland beings with the following changes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You summon up to three fey spirits.</li>
				<li>The combined challenge rating of the creatures must be less than or equal to your total character level.</li>
				<li>Each creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Once used, this property of the tattoo can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>As One.</em></strong> While holding Maginat, when one of your fey spirits within 30 feet of you hits a creature you can see with an attack, you can use your reaction to empower its attack by channeling your javelin’s mystic power. The target of the fey spirit’s attack takes an extra 6d6 force damage.</p>

				<p>The goddess of the hunt, Oria, once took a liking to a dwarven youngling who, by chance, escaped the jaws of a great winged beast that snatched her away from her family. A windstorm impelled the mighty bird to loosen its grip, and the youngling fell deep into the forest below.</p>
				<p class="indent">She was soon discovered by a tribe of half-orc hunters, who found her innocence and stubby stature amusing. They raised the youngling among their kind, teaching her the ways of their tribe and naming her Clove. Though she often stumbled in her education, Clove’s efforts were admirable and noted by Oria.</p>
				<p class="indent">In maturity, Clove joined the tribe’s hunting parties as a valued huntress and felt a sacred connection with the beasts of the forest. When it came time for her pledge markings, the tribe’s tattooist was visited by Oria herself, who instructed them to mark the youngling with her blessing. The forest would from then on be protected by Clove— gentle dwarf and Oria’s champion.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo was designed through divine inspiration in honor of the Sea Deity, Tavara.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Tattoo.</em></strong> You can only attune to this tattoo if you are attuned to no more than one other magic item. If you attune to more than one other magic item while you are attuned to this tattoo, your attunement to this tattoo immediately ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">While this tattoo is applied on your skin, you are resistant to cold damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can manifest a majestic trident known as Dagat whose blows sound like ocean waves crashing against rocks when they strike true. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, with which you are proficient. Instead of the trident’s usual piercing damage, Dagat deals cold damage equal to 1d10 plus your ability modifier on a hit and has the versatile (1d12) and thrown (range 20/60) properties. While holding this weapon, you can breathe underwater and have a swimming speed of 60 feet. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the trident.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Maelstrom.</em></strong> As an action, you can spin the trident wildly in your hands to form a vortex; a 15-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall cylinder of raging winds and water that moves with you. The area becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than you for the duration. You can maintain this effect as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell).</p>
			<p class="indent">For the duration, attack rolls made against you have disadvantage. A creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the vortex must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet toward the vortex’s center.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a Large or smaller creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and does not fall prone.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once used, this property of the tattoo can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fatal Catch.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can manifest a magic thread that wraps itself around your forearm, tethering you to Dagat, and then make a ranged weapon attack with the trident against a creature within range. On a hit, in addition to the trident’s normal damage, the creature must succeed in a Strength contest against you or be pulled up to 60 feet towards you. A gargantuan creature automatically succeeds on this Strength contest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once used, this property of the tattoo can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

				<p>Legend speaks of a wealthy noblewoman named Valeria Holliver who lost her husband and son when their ship was attacked by ruthless pirates. The noblewoman, upon hearing of her family’s demise, sold her home and most of her worldly possessions.</p>
				<p class="indent">She used her earnings to hire a crew and buy a ship with the goal of enacting vengeance upon those who took her loved ones away.</p>
				<p class="indent">The crew was an eclectic array of seafarers, among which was an old tattooist-sailor. The ship, which came to be known as the Howling Maiden, spent several years sailing the seas, defending smaller ships from pirate attacks, rescuing sea creatures in harm’s way, and protecting the ecosystem. Sea life flourished under the watchful eye of the Howling Maiden, and slowly Valeria’s heart warmed to a new purpose: to protect those who could not protect themselves.</p>
				<p class="indent">After many years as captain of the ship, Valeria commissioned the tattooist-sailor to create a design that she could bear as a symbol of her commitment to the seas. Inspired by the good work they had done, the tattooist made a full-body suit to symbolize Valeria’s strength and guardianship. He would later remark that it felt as though his hand was being guided as he crafted the tattoo. Once applied, Valeria quickly realized the tattoo came with divine properties, blessed in recognition of the noblewoman’s stewardship over the goddess’ domain.</p>

			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo was designed through divine inspiration in honor of the Sky Deity, Kor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Tattoo.</em></strong> You can only attune to this tattoo if you are attuned to no more than one other magic item. If you attune to more than one other magic item while you are attuned to this tattoo, your attunement to this tattoo immediately ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">While this tattoo is applied on your skin, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You also have resistance to lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can manifest a wooden sling known as Tirador that is etched with tales of heroic exploits. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, with which you are proficient. It deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 plus you ability modifier on a hit. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the sling.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Wind Pellet.</em></strong> All ammunition fired from the sling is magically infused with volatile air pressure. Any creature you hit must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 3d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one. In both cases, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sky King.</em></strong> As an action while outside, you can fire your sling into the sky. This causes a churning magical storm cloud with a 200-foot radius to form, centered above you. You can maintain this effect as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell). Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. All ranged weapon attacks apart from those made with Tirador that travel through any part of the area under the storm cloud automatically miss. Additionally, the wind and rain form a severe distraction; creatures other than you have disadvantage on any checks and saving throws made to maintain their concentration. Once used, this property of the tattoo can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">While this effect is active, each creature you hit with an attack from your sling must also make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes as a bolt of lightning crashes down upon them. </p>

				<p>Once upon a time, there was a princess who was the only offspring of a mountain chief, an ever-suspicious leader who doted on his heir. Fearful of his rivals, the mountain chief kept the princess in hiding below the mountaintops, tucked away in an isolated cave with a troupe of guards. They surveyed the highlands for threats, while the princess was kept safe near the shore. She was provided with an elderly caregiver and a young companion to keep her company, her only friend during her many years of isolation.</p>
				<p class="indent">One night, a young warrior of the ocean lost his way and came ashore, stumbling upon the princess reading, awake as all her world slept.</p>
				<p class="indent">Fascinated by each other, the pair would continue these starlight visits. Alas, the eyes of her guards were not forever turned. When the lovers’ trysts were discovered, the princess was whisked away, but not before she could beseech her companion to impart a farewell on her behalf.</p>
				<p class="indent">Kor, god of the sky, took pity upon the princess and warrior. He visited the princess’ young companion, blessing her to carry out his will. Upon the warrior’s next visit, the companion imparted the words of the princess and relayed the will of Kor.</p>
				<p class="indent">The blessed companion then laid her hand on the saddened warrior, conferring a divine mark and the confidence to confront the mountain chief.</p>
				<p class="indent">At the top of the highest mountain, the warrior of the ocean approached the throne of his beloved’s father. The chief readied to attack, but tempered his reaction when he saw the warrior’s markings aglow with divine light. With great reluctance, the chief listened to the stranger’s tale and conceded that the warrior was worthy. The warrior soon discovered that his markings came with great power, and eventually, a union was granted between the son of the ocean and the daughter of the sky.</p>

				<p>Those of purest soul attract the attention of the sun deity, Alo. Such was the case when a young woman gave birth to a son named Brun for his glowing brass-colored eyes. Cast out by her strict, superstitious clan, the mother and her child lived in hardship until they settled themselves among the merchants of a bustling port. The mother managed to join the ranks of the port’s street merchants and earned a living weaving baskets, while her growing son took on odd jobs from street vendors, adventurers, and passing sailors.</p>
				<p class="indent">While his eyes had long since lost their glow, there was still something special about Brun. He became a fond fixture at the port as he grew into a young man, making friends with several vendors, one of whom was an aging tattooist. One day, the street merchants were being harassed by bandits hired by the mother’s old clan. The corrupt clan was attempting to assert themselves as “keepers of law and order” in the area, and demanded that the port inhabitants start paying a tax for their protection. As the merchants weighed their options, the tattooist was visited by Alo himself. He directed the tattooist to give “the boy of pureness and brass” his mark and blessing. The tattooist convinced Brun to take on the markings of Alo, and Brun’s eyes glowed once more. He stood up to the bandits and the clan, using the tattoo’s power to defend the port from their advances whenever they grew too bold.</p>

				<p>When the gods look to mortals for their entertainment, the inconceivable often ensues. In one instance, a young jungle sprite known as Pimble withstood the daily taunting of their peers and drew the attention of the divine. Often the butt of their jokes, Pimble would also be tossed into murky swamps or be relieved of their morning forage of bananas, guavas, and other sustenance for the day.</p>
				<p class="indent">Despite this cruelty, Pimble never hid, but would begin to train themselves to withstand pain by standing underneath a raging waterfall. The process was grueling and only seemed to cause more injuries to the sprite. Despite this, they returned every day to endure.</p>
				<p class="indent">Weeks later, the thunder god Raiko, amused by the sprite’s stubbornness, decided to imbue magic into the falling waters as the day turned to dusk.</p>
				<p class="indent">Pimble’s skin, usually numb from the beating of the waterfall, tingled and glowed, and strange markings began to appear across their body. They felt a divine energy course through them and thanked the gods for this gift. Raiko was delighted to see the sprite stand up to its stunned bullies, and never again was Pimble the butt of their jokes.</p>

The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be consumed by a plume of flame, taking 10d10 fire damage.

				<p>There are tales of a nomad that roams the eastern countryside, with no real connection to any village or individual in the area. The nomad, bearing a forlorn expression and a shabby cloak that whispers of former elegance, attracts much attention with their ageless face and stately aura.</p>
				<p class="indent">On the heels of the nomad, rumors follow of tragic loss and unspeakable betrayal, but the silent drifter does not speak. Any fools with enough daring to provoke the nomad survive only long enough to warn others of a mighty temper and otherworldly powers, manifesting when the nomad throws off their cloak to reveal a body covered in strange, glowing markings.</p>
				<p class="indent">It is not yet known how the nomad came to bear such markings, though tattooists over the years have claimed knowledge and even authorship of the design. None of these claims have been proven true, and the nomad continues to wander the outskirts of the eastern villages to this day.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo was designed through divine inspiration in honor of the War Deity, Duma.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Tattoo.</em></strong> You can only attune to this tattoo if you are attuned to no more than one other magic item. If you attune to more than one other magic item while you are attuned to this tattoo, your attunement to this tattoo immediately ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">While this tattoo is applied on your skin, you are resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can manifest a broken spear known as Lakas that looks worn. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, with which you are proficient.</p>
			<p class="indent">Instead of a spear’s normal piercing damage, Lakas deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus your ability modifier on a hit, has the versatile (1d10) property, and ignores resistance to piercing damage. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the spear.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Reforge.</em></strong> As an action, you can raise Lakas to the heavens and magically restore it to its former glory for the next minute. For the duration, the spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack using Lakas, that creature takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage. Once used, this property of the tattoo can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">While Lakas is reforged, you can activate the Antispell and Shields Up properties, After you activate one of these properties, roll a d6. On a 1, you can’t activate either property again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Antispell.</em></strong> You can cast the counterspell spell at will (+5 spellcasting ability modifier).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shields Up.</em></strong> As a reaction when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see is hit by an attack, you can grant it a protective magical shield that rests on its forearm (unless it is already wearing a shield). The creature gains a +2 bonus to its AC until the start of its next turn. You can declare this after the attack die is rolled but before the action is resolved.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5 class="caption">LORE</h5>
				<p>The war deity Duma values valor and honor, and those who show restraint as well as mercy to enemies they have overcome. The great Qinju, mighty general in the ancient kingdom of Talin, was one such warrior. Qinju reined in the bloodlust of his first emperor, and nurtured their more tolerable and fair-minded heir. Qinju’s efforts resulted in prosperity throughout the kingdom and treaties with neighboring lands. He established a generation of soldiers worthy of their own tales. In honor of his labor, the aging general was visited by Duma who bestowed special markings upon him to enhance his abilities and prolong his righteous influence over Talin. The lessons of General Qinju are still applied in the training of soldiers, guards, and knights all over the world to this day.</p>
