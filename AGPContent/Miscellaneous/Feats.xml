			While you are wearing heavy armor and a shield, allies within 5 feet of you gain the benefits of half cover as long as you aren't incapacitated.&#13;
			When a creature within 5 feet of you is targeted with an attack, and you use your reaction to grant the attack roll disadvantage, you can reduce the damage that creature takes on a hit by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus, you then take that amount of damage instead.</description>
