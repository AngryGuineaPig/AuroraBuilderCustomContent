		<prerequisite>Spellcasting</prerequisite>
		<description>
		<p>You adopt a particular style of spellcasting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Spellcasting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again. Each Spellcasting Style also includes examples of spells that can be affected.</p>
		<p class="indent">Cantrips are ingrained into a person's memory and actions, and thus can't be affected by Spellcasting Styles.</p>
		<p class="indent"><b>Receiving Spellcasting Styles.</b> The DM can bestow a spellcasting style upon a spellcaster for any fair reason. You could recieve one at character creation, when you learn a certain level of spell, or by spending time learning under a master of magic. You could also be given one if you get the Ability Score Improvement class feature, regardless of whether you improve your ability scores or choose a feat.</p>
		<p class="indent">Ideally, all spellcasters in a party should receive a spellcasting style at the same time, or close to it.</p>
		<p class="indent"><b>Class Restrictions.</b>Not all spellcasting styles are made for the same type of campaign, and not all of them are equally viable in similar scenarios. Because of this, there is a list of classes under some spellcasting styles. Unless you are a member of that class, you are unable to take that spellcasting style. Of course, your DM may remove or modify these prerequisites to suit the party.</p>
		<p class="indent">If a spellcasting style has no prerequisite class listed, then it can be assumed that any class can take it.</p>
