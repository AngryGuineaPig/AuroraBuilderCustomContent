			<h5>TENETS OF WAR</h5>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Violence Versus War.</i></b> War is grand and glorious. Killing someone in a dark alley with a dagger, or poisoning their wine is not. Knot that difference and ensure you don't cross that line.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>The Front Lines Await.</i></b> Their is no honour in waiting behind the barricade. Wade nto the thick of battle and let your foes face your fury.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Always Be Prepared.</i></b> Those who let their guard down died before they find glory. Always be ready to fight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Fight Only The Worthy.</i></b> You seek opponents, not victims. You should not bathe your blade in the blood of the weak, it will only grow nourished on the blood of the strong.</p>
