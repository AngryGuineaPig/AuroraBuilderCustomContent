			<p>Many Paladins pledge themselves to gods. Very few pledge themselves to the elements or the world itself.</p>
			<h5>TENETS OF The Primordials</h5>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Environment First.</i></b> Your actions should show those around you that the environment and the elements is of the utmost importance. You must attempt to do away with those who would destroy it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Embody the Elements.</i></b> Be as passionate as fire. As adaptable as water. As steadfast as stone. As free as the wind. As verbose as thunder. As quick as lightning.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Speak the Splendor.</i></b> When possible, and when there are those willing to listen, teach them the wonders and splendors of the natural world. Before attempting to destroy those who would destroy it, teach them why it is worth protecting.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Restoration.</i></b> In the case of environmental damage, heal and restore what is possible, when possible for you.</p>
