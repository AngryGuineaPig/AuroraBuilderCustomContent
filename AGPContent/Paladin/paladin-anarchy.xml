			<p>The Oath of Anarch swears paladins to ideals of liberty, collectivism and a rejection of hierarchical rulership.</p>
			<h5>TENETS OF ANARCHY</h5>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Liberty.</i></b> Chains imposed by unjust authority are meant to be broken.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Revolution.</i></b> Change is only brought through sudden transformational struggle.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Independence.</i></b> There shall be no lords over others. Power is best left in the hands of the people.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Equity.</i></b> Each individual has equal worth. Hierarchies only lead to injustice.</p>
