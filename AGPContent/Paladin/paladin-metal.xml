			<p>Paladins taking on the Oath of Metal have realized the meaning of life. Life doesn't matter. There is no greater purpose, the strong survives, the weak perish. Heaven and Hell are just places like any other. Death is just another road to walk on, and in the end, we shall all become children of the grave, deep in the iced earth.</p>
			<h5>TENETS OF METAL</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of Metal teaches to accept mortality. At the gates of death, only doom awaits. Your carcass shall be eaten, when the vultures come. Everybody dies.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Heavy and Metal.</i></b> Be it weapons or amor, you do not take anything but the largest and heaviest of them. Always made of metal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Man of War.</i></b> Sworn t fight and die, you are among the metal warriors of the world. You shall bring destruction, suffering and pain. War is the answer.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Holy War.</i></b> Gods do not walk the earth, they need you to fight their wars, and die for them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Fear of the Dark.</i></b> You are the reason men are afraid of the dark. Show them why they fear.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>For Whom The Bell Tolls.</i></b> You can use your channel divinity to fill your enemies with dread and feelings of immediate doom, as they hear the toll of a bell, signaling their own demise. As an action you can force a creature within 60 feet of you to make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 3d10 + your paladin level in necrotic damage and they are frightened of you until the end of your next turn. While frightened in this way their speed is 0 and they cannot benefit from any bonus to their speed On a success they take half damage and aren't frightened.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Heaviest Matter of the Universe.</i></b> You can use your channel divinity to magically add weight to your weapon, making a strike hit harder. As a bonus action you transform your weapon for 1 minute, it gains the heavy property and you must have a Strength score of 16 or more to continue o wield it. While transformed this way, you add 1d8 damage to damage rolls made with the weapon. For the duration the weapon is also considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances.</p>
