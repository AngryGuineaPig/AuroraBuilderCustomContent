			<p>Not all wizards spend their entire lives reading books in a library and hiding from combat throwing spells from afar. Some prefer to stand next to their opponent as they launch a firebolt into their chest. Though often frowned upon these mages stand in the thick of combat an it isn't uncommon for them to use weapons as spell focuses.</p>

			<p><em>6th-level Melee Magic feature</em></p>
			<p>When you cast a spell, instead of casting it at a range you can teleport up to the target as long as the spell would reach to an an unoccupied space, (a 30ft spell allows you to teleport 30ft towards a creature but only if the spell hits) you must then make this spell attack within 5ft. Once done this reduces your speed to 0 if it were not already. If you do this a creature has disadvantage on dexterity saves as it would be surprised.</p>
