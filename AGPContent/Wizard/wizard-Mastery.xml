			<p>At 2nd level you gain advantage to hit or induce disadvantage for saving throws</p>
			<p>At 6th level you reduce the casting time to a bonus action if it isn't already</p>
			<p>At 10th level you can choose a number of dice equivalent to your intelligence modifier to reroll for damage, you can choose to use the new roll or the old rolls. You can do this a number of time = your intelligence modifier per short rest.</p>
			<p>At 14th level you can choose to cast it using a spell slot one level lower then you cast it, (an 8th level fireball uses a 7th level spell slot) you can use this a number of times = your intelligence modifier per short rest.</p>
