			<p>Your knowledge of life and death allows you to steal the life energy from creatures touched by your dark spells. Once per turn when you reduce one or more creatures to 0 hit points with a spell of 1st level or higher you gain temporary hit points equal to double the spell level, or three times if the damage was necrotic or was a necromancy spell. Alternatively, when a creature within 30ft of you is reduced to 0 hit points you can use your reaction to reap its life and regain 3 hit points.</p>

			<p><em>6th-level School of Entropy feature</em></p>
			<p>Starting at 6th level, you've learned to suffuse your spells with negative energy, leaving your enemies weakened and vulnerable. Whenever you successfully hit one or more creatures with a spell that deals necrotic damage, or one or more creatures fail a save against a necromancy spell, you can choose a number of those creatures equal to half your wizard level, to suffer one of the following effects:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Festering Wounds.</b> Whenever the creature takes damage they take an additional 1d4 necrotic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Withering Muscle.</b> The creature's movement speeds are reduced by 10 and it subtracts 1d4 from all damage rolls it makes.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Decaying Mind.</b> The target has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration, also they have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma checks and saves.</p>
			<p class="ident"><b>Rotting Flesh.</b> The creature can't regain hit points</p>
			<p>You can use this feature a number of times equivalent to your wisdom modifier per long rest and the effects last 1 minute</p>
