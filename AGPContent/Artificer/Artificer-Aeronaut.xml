			<p>One of the most dangerous obsessions an artificer can pursue has always been mechanical flight. Many strive for this lofty goal, and all but the most dedicated, and often the most foolhardy, artificers fail in their pursuits. Experiments that end in disastrous explosions, catastrophic falls from the sky, and deadly malfunctions are not out of the norm for an Aeronaut perfecting their mechanical flying machine. You constantly strive to achieve the lofty goal of every Aeronaut, the creation of an arcane flying machine.</p>

			<p>Upon reaching 3rd level, your experiments with flight have paid off. At the end of a long rest, as long as you have access to your woodcarver's tools, you can construct a flying machine, choosing its appearance. Your flying machine is a magical item that requires attunement and can be used as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. It is constructed to fit your size, and It can be worn over normal clothing and light or medium armor. You must spend time during each long rest maintaining your flying machine with woodcarver's tools. If you do not, your flying machine ceases to function.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you have your flying machine equipped and attuned, you gain a 15 foot flying speed. This flying speed does not stack with flying speeds gained from other features or spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">At certain artificer levels, this flying speed increases: to 20 feet at 5th level, 30 feet at 9th level, and 60 feet at 15th level.</p>
