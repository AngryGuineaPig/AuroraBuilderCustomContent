		<description>
			<p>Starting at 3rd level you have discovered the way to create a Galvan Battery. A Galvan Battery is a small contraption of your design that gives off a dim light within a 5 ft radius and is either worn or embedded in armor and can be used as your spellcasting focus. It’s function is to try to contain extreme amounts of raw arcane power so that you can attempt to borrow and channel this energy to aid you in battle.</p>
			<p class="indent">Using Jewelers Tools, you can take a bonus action to begin charging your Galvan Battery. The charge lasts for 1 minute unless it is removed from your contact or until the energy explodes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once activated it immediately gains 1 charge and gains an additional charge at the start of each of your turns. Your movement speed is increased by 5 ft for every charge your Galvan Battery currently has.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once per turn, after you deal damage to a creature, you may deal additional damage to a creature with an attack or spell, you can deal an additional 1d8 lightning damage for each charge the Galvan Battery has to the target or a different creature within 15 ft of the target. In addition, if you roll the same number on any of the d8s, the Galvan Battery becomes unstable and the stored energy explodes. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking lightning damage equal to the numbers rolled on a failure, or half on a success. You automatically fail the save. As a bonus action, you can safety expel the energy out, removing all built up charges. Alternatively, as an action you can choose to have your Galvan Battery explode. If you do, you have advantage on the save instead of automatically failing.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you start charging your Galvan Battery, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest or until you expend a spell slot.</p>
