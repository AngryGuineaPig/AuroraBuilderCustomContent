		<description>
			<p>At 3rd level, you construct a chameleon engine: a device you can use to cloak your appearance. Your chameleon engine is a Tiny object; you decide your engine's appearance.</p>
			<p class="indent">While your chameleon engine is on your person, you can use your action and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to activate it. Your engine remains active for 1 hour, or until it is more than 5 feet away from you. As a bonus action, you can use your activated engine in one of the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You make yourself—and anything on your person—look different. You can't alter your height or width by more than 1 foot, and you can't change your body type. Touching your disguise reveals it to be illusory, because things can pass through it. Otherwise, you can look however you like.</li>
				<li>You blend into your surroundings, becoming invisible until you move, or until you take an action or reaction. The first time you cast an artificer spell while invisible, you can roll 1d8 and add the result to one damage roll of the spell.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Any of your engine's effects end early when it deactivates. You can activate your engine once without expending a spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">During a long rest, you can create a new chameleon engine if you have a set of thieves' tools with you. If you already have an engine from this feature, the first one is destroyed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 5th level, if you have your thieves' tools with you when you finish a long rest, you can disguise an arcane focus as an ordinary trinket, such as a watch, cane, or quill, turning it into a hidden weapon. Your hidden weapon doesn't appear magical to spells and effects such as detect magic. It returns to its true form if you use this feature again, or if you die.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use your hidden weapon as a spellcasting focus. When you cast an artificer spell through the hidden weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of the spell. In addition, if the spell has verbal components, you can ignore them if the spell also has somatic components.</p>
