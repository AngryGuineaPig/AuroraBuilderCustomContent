			<p>For centuries chroniclers and librarians have sought the best way to store vast troves of information. While most were satisfied with scrolls, tomes, and books, the first archivists strove for something greater, storing libraries worth of information in one solitary object, and created the first artificial minds. As an archivist, you are on the cutting edge of arcane advancement. Like all new breakthroughs, you must be careful with who you allow to witness this ability. How will you use your fringe ability to create artificial intelligence?</p>

			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can awaken artificial minds. At the end of each long rest, you can touch a Tiny nonmagical object with calligrapher's supplies, awakening a mind within. While the mind is inside it, the object is a magic item that requires attunement, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus. If you rouse an artificial mind while you already have one from this feature, the mind transfers to the new object. While attuned to the mind, you gain the following features:</p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Information Overload. </em>Your artificial mind can overload the minds of your enemies with information. As an action, you can force a creature that you can see within 30 feet to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 psychic damage and disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. The damage of this feature increases as you gain levels in this class: to 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th, and 4d8 at 17th level.</p>
