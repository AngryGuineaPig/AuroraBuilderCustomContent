			<p>Your intimate knowledge of warfare and arcane magic allows you to combine both with ease. Starting at 3rd level, you learn to forge an arcane armament. At the end of each long rest, you touch one melee weapon and turn it into your arcane armament, granting it the following properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The weapon you is considered magic if it was not already.</li>
				<li>You can use your Intelligence, in place of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.</li>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls with it, unless the base weapon granted a higher bonus. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th-level and +3 at 15th-level.</li>
				<li>It can bear one of your infusions, even if it was already a magic item before becoming your arcane armament.</li>
				<li>Bonuses to attack an damage rolls innate to the weapon, or from an infusion, do not stack with the bonuses from this feature. You must choose one instance to use.</li>

			<p class="indent">Your arcane armament is usable only by you. Enchanting a second weapon causes the magic in the first to end.</p>
