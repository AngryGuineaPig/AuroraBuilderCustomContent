      <p>Where most bards refine the music they use in their magic, bards from the College of Cacophony focus on the strings of magic in music in their most brutal, raw form. Somewhat esoteric and, by many considered experimental, these bards often attract specific individuals and perform at specific venues as they are a far cry of most bards.</p>

      <p>Starting at 14th level you gain the ability to react instinctively to disrupt magical incantations. When a creature you can see and hear within 60ft of you casts a spell with a vocal component, you can use your reaction to attempt to disrupt that spell. The target must make a concentration save or lose concentration on the spell and have it fail. They still expend the spell slot but the spell has no effect. You can do this once per long rest.</p>
